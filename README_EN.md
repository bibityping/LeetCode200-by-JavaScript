## What is LeetCode 200?

---

Data structures and algorithms are essential skills for every programmer to pass the interview. The data and algorithm questions in this repository are about 200 selected by CyC2018 in LeetCode, excluding some complicated but not much algorithmic ideas, in addition to retaining the classic questions that are often asked in the interview.

The CyC2018 repository helped me practice LeetCode questions in an efficient way. The CyC2018 problem solving language is Java, and I use JavaScript, so I created this repository to share JS solutions and also as a record of my practice notes.
